"""
A Sphinx extension implementing `pProlog` syntax highlighting and `infobox`,
`exercise`, `solution` and `swish` directives used to author Prolog-infused
interactive online resources.
This extension is compatible with, and intended for, Jupyter Book.

See `this tutorial <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/tutorials/todo.html>`_
for more details on building custom directives.
`This <http://www.xavierdupre.fr/blog/2015-06-07_nojs.html>`_ blog post is also
useful.
`docutils`' nodes description is available
`here <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/doctree.html>`_, and their
documentation `here <http://code.nabla.net/doc/docutils/api/docutils/nodes/>`_.

There are two lists of 3rd party extension that can be used as a reference:
`awesome-sphinxdoc <https://github.com/yoloseem/awesome-sphinxdoc>`_ and
`sphinx extension survey <https://sphinxext-survey.readthedocs.io/>`_.
The `sphinxcontrib-proof <https://framagit.org/spalax/sphinxcontrib-proof/>`_
extension was particularly useful for developing the `exercise` directive.

    Includes the contents of the `_static` directory distributed with this
    extension.
    (Should be attached to the `builder-inited` Sphinx event.)

    In addition to the `html_static_path` loading path, Sphinx also uses
    `html_extra_path`.
    This variable can be accessed via:

    * `self.state.document.settings.env.config.html_static_path`
      for directives and
    * `self.document.settings.env.config.html_static_path` for nodes.

    `html_static_path is relative to `self.document.settings.env.app.confdir`,
    and the build directory can be obtained from
    `document.settings.env.app.builder.outdir`.

    Alternatively, files can be copied manually by attaching a dedicated
    function to the `build-finished` Sphinx event::

       from sphinx.util.fileutil import copy_asset

       def copy_asset_files(app, exc):
           asset_files = [...]
           if exc is None:  # build succeeded
               for path in asset_files:
                   copy_asset(path, os.path.join(app.outdir, '_static'))
